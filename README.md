# Marketing-Customer-Segmentation-Using-RFM
This project focuses on customer segmentation using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model. RFM analysis is a powerful technique in marketing analytics that helps businesses identify different customer groups based on their purchasing behavior, enabling data-driven strategies for customer retention, engagement, and targeting.
## Project Overview
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing (Online Retail.xlsx)
- Created RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) scores and segmented customers into groups (Customer_seqmentation.ipynb).
- Visualized customer segments dashboard for business insights by Power BI (Customers.pbix).
## Customer Segments depending on RFM and Dashborad by Power BI.
The following segmentation map was used:
- hibernating – inactive customers who haven’t purchased recently.
- at_risk – previously valuable customers who are becoming inactive.
- cant_lose – important customers who are at high risk of churning.
- about_to_sleep – low-engagement customers who may soon stop buying.
- need_attention – customers with moderate engagement who require nurturing.
- loyal_customers – consistent and reliable buyers.
- promising – recent buyers who show potential for growth.
- new_customers – first-time buyers.
- potential_loyalists – engaged buyers who can become loyal with encouragement.
- champions – the most valuable, highly engaged customers.
